A Little Programming Test
=========================
These little code snippets can prove that even the simplest projects might
come with severe BUGs.
Your task is to propose patch fixes to alpt-*.c small projects, in order to
make them run smoothly and sanely. Explain, on each patch, how your changes
address the issues you found out, and why it is a necessary fix.

- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
$ make


- RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
$ ./alpt-<ID>


- EXPECTED RESULTS:
$ ./alpt-<ID> &> /dev/null && echo $?
0


Happy bug hunting!
